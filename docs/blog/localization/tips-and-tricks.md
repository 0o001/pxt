# MakeCode Translation Tips and Tricks

**Posted on April 25th, 2022 by [anzhou5](https://github.com/anzhou5)**

## A quick guide to translating our MakeCode editor

Our MakeCode editor reaches across the globe, and we are so excited and appreciative every time we are able to release a new language onto our website! Fun fact: since we are a small team, our language accessibility is almost entirely thanks to a community of volunteer translators! If you would like to get involved or want to learn more, please visit [our Crowdin page](https://crowdin.com/project/makecode) to check us out.

Translating for us can be confusing, though, and we want to take a moment to highlight some tips.

### Tip #1: Getting a language published
While we offer many languages as options for translation on Crowdin, not all the languages appear on our MakeCode websites (for micro:bit, Arcade, etc.). This is because we require some level of translation to be completed before we enable a language on our site. This typically means at least 85% translation completion of our key files that comprise 3 key parts of each language:

1)	User interface strings on the editor websites
2)	The core blocks which are loaded with the default project (ex. that are not extensions) 
3)	Additional blocks specific to the editor in question. For example, micro:bit has servo blocks and strings for things like downloading code onto the device

### Tip #2: Tasks
Wait a second, if the relevant files vary across the editors, how can a person know which ones to translate in order to get a language onto the MakeCode website? This is great question that our team can help with using a Crowdin feature! If it doesnâ€™t exist already, one of our team members can create a [task](https://support.crowdin.com/tasks/) that will show you the relevant files that you still need to translate and progress towards your goal. Once you have achieved the translation goal and have it all confirmed by a proofreader, you can message our Crowdin account and we will do a final review and schedule a release.

### Tip #3: Direct-from-document vs. in-context translations
To help our translators and proofreaders visualize that it is that they are translating, we have a tool that we call [in-context translations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OugXfqhWUQo). This allows you to look at our site and directly click on things you want to translate. Any translations you put into our in-context tool will directly push into our Crowdin! We do want to note that this tool does have some bugs still and we encourage you to refresh the page a few times if you experience any and provide us with feedback.
