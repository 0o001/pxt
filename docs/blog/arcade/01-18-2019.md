# Microsoft MakeCode Arcade

**Posted on January 18, 2019 by XYZ*

[Microsoft MakeCode Arcade](https://arcade.microsoft.com) 
is a web-based beginner-friendly code editor to create retro arcade games 
for the web and for microcontrollers.  As usual with MakeCode, you can 
either use blocks or JavaScript to build your program in your browser. There's 
nothing to install - it just works!  Through our hardware partners, you'll be
able to buy or build your own MakeCode Arcade compatible game systems.

###  What's in MakeCode Arcade?

MakeCode Arcade supports a 160x120 screen with 16 colors, 
and has a 2D game engine with sprites, platformer-style collisions, 
tile maps, particle systems and more! This design space allows for
an incredible amount of creativity, as well as deployment of the resulting
games from the web browser to inexpensive battery-powered 
microcontroller-based systems.

### Sprite Editor and Gallery

A major part of the fun of Arcade is designing your own sprites. 
To make this easier, Arcade has a sprite editor 
along with a gallery of specially designed sprites for your use:

The sprite editor is available both from the Blocks and JavaScript editors.
