###  What's in MakeCode Arcade?

MakeCode Arcade supports a 160x120 screen with 16 colors, 
and has a 2D game engine with sprites, platformer-style collisions, tile maps, particle systems and more! This design space allows for
an incredible amount of creativity, as well as deployment of the resulting
games from the web browser to inexpensive battery-powered 
microcontroller-based systems.

As usual with MakeCode Arcade, you can either use blocks or JavaScript 
to build your program in your browser. There's nothing to install - it just works!

### Sprite Editor and Gallery

A major part of the fun of Arcade is designing your sprites. 
To make this easier, Arcade has a sprite editor 
along with a gallery of specially designed sprites for your use:

The sprite editor is available both from the Blocks and JavaScript editors.
